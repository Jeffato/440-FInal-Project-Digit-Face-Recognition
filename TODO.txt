Read data - DONE

Perceptron- Faces - DONE
    Feature Extraction
    Training 10, 20 ... 100%
    70% Acc

Perceptron- Digits - DONE, kinda
    Feature Extraction
    Training 10, 20 ... 100%
    70% Acc -> not really but good enough

- Explain the test results, graphs and discuss any observations.

Instructions:
1. All team members need to be present during the demo.
2. Have the code ready for display.
3. Put the results and the graphs in a presentation (for everything asked in the assignment document). Have this ready for display as well.
